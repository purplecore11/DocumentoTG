	abstract = {On 14 November 2007, a subduction thrust earthquake, magnitude Mw = 7.8, occurred in the coastal region of northern Chile, causing substantial damage to the city of Tocopilla. We investigate the source fault of the earthquake, slip distribution and fault interaction by integrating aftershock locations, satellite interferometry data and stress model simulations. Aftershock measurements allow us to locate the area and geometry of the rupture plane in the coastal region between the cities of Tocopilla and Antofagasta. Combining two satellite viewing geometries, acquired in Envisat's Wide Swath and Image modes, we observe decimetre-scale coseismic deformation. The maximum line-of-sight displacement is found to be about 40cm, located at the Mejillones Peninsula. Slip inversions using elastic half-space models with geometry constrained by aftershocks suggest rupturing of an area of ∼160km by ∼50km along the Nazca–South America convergent margin between latitudes 22°S and 23.5°S. The main slip is concentrated on two asperities, the largest being located in the southern part of the rupture area at a depth of approximately 30–50km with a magnitude of about 2.5m. Because aftershock distribution may also suggest a region of shallow crustal deformation activity located offshore, we investigate whether the 2007 Tocopilla earthquake also involved shallow crustal fault slip offshore. Although we find that the latter assumption is supported by Coulomb stress modelling and geologic inferences, our geodetic and seismic data provide insufficient constraints to resolve the exact geometry and kinematics of dislocation on this structure.},

	abstract = {The Mw 7.7 2007 November 14 earthquake had an epicentre located close to the city of Tocopilla, at the southern end of a known seismic gap in North Chile. Through modelling of Global Positioning System (GPS) and radar interferometry (InSAR) data, we show that this event ruptured the deeper part of the seismogenic interface (30–50 km) and did not reach the surface. The earthquake initiated at the hypocentre and was arrested ∼150 km south, beneath the Mejillones Peninsula, an area already identiﬁed as an important structural barrier between two segments of the Peru–Chile subduction zone. Our preferred models for the Tocopilla main shock show slip concentrated in two main asperities, consistent with previous inversions of seismological data. Slip appears to have propagated towards relatively shallow depths at its southern extremity, under the Mejillones Peninsula. Our analysis of post-seismic deformation suggests that small but still signiﬁcant post-seismic slip occurred within the ﬁrst 10 d after the main shock, and that it was mostly concentrated at the southern end of the rupture. The post-seismic deformation occurring in this period represents ∼12–19 per cent of the coseismic deformation, of which ∼30–55 per cent has been released aseismically. Postseismic slip appears to concentrate within regions that exhibit low coseismic slip, suggesting that the afterslip distribution during the ﬁrst month of the post-seismic interval complements the coseismic slip. The 2007 Tocopilla earthquake released only ∼2.5 per cent of the moment deﬁcit accumulated on the interface during the past 130 yr and may be regarded as a possible precursor of a larger subduction earthquake rupturing partially or completely the 500-km-long North Chile seismic gap.},

	abstract = {Earthquakes are accompanied by coseismic and post-seismic rebound: blocks of crust on either side of the fault spring back to their initial, undeformed configuration. This rebound is well documented by space geodetic data, such as the Global Positioning System. Thus, all earthquake-induced deformation of the crust is considered non-permanent and is modelled as an elastic or visco-elastic process. Here, however, we show that earthquakes larger than magnitude 7 in northern Chile caused the crust to deform permanently. We identify millimetre- to metre-scale tension cracks in the crust of the Atacama Desert and use cosmogenic nuclides to date the timing of crack formation. The cracks were formed by between 2,000 and 9,000 individual plate-boundary earthquakes that occurred in the past 0.8–1 million years. We show that up to 10\% of the horizontal deformation generated during the earthquakes, recorded by Global Positioning System data and previously assumed to be recoverable, is permanent. Our data set provides a record of permanent strain in the shallow crust of the South American Plate. Although deformation of the deep crust may be predominantly elastic, we conclude that modelling of the earthquake cycle should also include a significant plastic component.},

	abstract = {The extreme aridity of the northern Chilean Coastal Cordillera enables the complete preservation of permanent deformation related to the coupling between Nazca and South America. The region between Antofagasta and Arica is characterized by four types of Late Cenozoic structures: EW-striking reverse faults; {\textasciitilde}NS-striking normal faults; sparse WNW and NNW-striking right-lateral strike–slip faults; and unimodal and bimodal populations of surface cracks. The EW reverse faults occur only between 19° and 21°40' S latitude and have been active since at least 6 Ma to present. A March 2007 earthquake demonstrates that this deformation can occur during the interseismic phase of the plate boundary seismic cycle. The NS-normal faults are most abundant near Antofagasta and Mejillones and diminish in signiﬁcance northward. Several of these faults, in both the Antofagasta and the Salar Grande area, have been reactivated as reverse faults causing minor topographic inversion. We suggest that normal faults move during both interseismic and coseismic deformation and are fundamentally very weak. Surface cracks are ubiquitous throughout the region and form by both non-tectonic and tectonic mechanisms. A signiﬁcant proportion forms during coseismic deformation and thus may be used to identify long-lived rupture segments on the plate boundary. Overall, forearc deformation is very slow, with permanent strain rates of 1–5 nstrain/year and fault slip rates less than 0.5 mm/year.},

	abstract = {The Mejillones Peninsula, located in northern Chile, represents a site of interest for seismic hazards assessment due to {\textasciitilde}100-year seismic gap, the potentially large site eﬀects, and the presence of the most important port in the region. In addition, the western edge of the Pampa Mejillones is limited by the Mejillones Fault, which controls the development of the Mejillones Basin to the east. In this research, we created a dynamic characterization of the northern portion of the basin using an integrated modeling of geophysics observations. These observations were: gravimetric method, magneto-telluric method (MT) and multichannel analysis of surface waves. The results of the geophysical campaign show soil thicknesses up to 750 m on the deeper zone with steeper slopes to the west and lower slopes to the east, in agreement with the normal-fault half-graben basin geometry. The sedimentary stratum is characterized by shear velocities between 300 and 700 m/s, extremely low electrical resistivities (below 1 Ω-m) and densities from 1.4 to 1.8 g/cm3. The integrated interpretation allowed us to generate a spatial and petrophysical model of the Mejillones Basin, from which we studied the seismic behavior of the zone. Preliminary results of the dynamic site ampliﬁcation (using the Spectral Element Method) show peak ground accelerations (PGA) of almost 100\% higher than the solicitation and stronger basinedge eﬀects. In this work, we demonstrate that the presented methodology (integrated geophysical characterization and numerical simulation) can be applied to characterize any deep forearc basin to quantify their seismic response in order to assess their seismic hazard.},

	abstract = {In the Mejillones Formation, a shallow-marine Pleistocene succession of northern Chile, the cyclic stratigraphic record is the result of the complex interaction of regional uplift, glacio-eustasy, local tectonics, sediment supply, and sedimentary processes. Stratal geometries, characteristics of sedimentary facies, and nature of sequence-bounding unconformities have been investigated to evaluate the influence of: (i) intrabasinal, short-term normal faulting on both along-strike variations in sequence architecture and genetic complexity of key stratal surfaces; and (ii) long-term regional uplift on sequence stacking pattern. The stratigraphic succession, dissected by small-displacement (few meters) normal faults striking obliquely with respect to the palaeo-shoreline trends, displays systematic variations in sequence architecture and the nature of bounding surfaces across them. Indeed, depending on position with respect to the fault plane, two basic types of internal organisation can be recognised in the examined shallowmarine, almost clastic-starved sequence. Within grabens it consists of a siliciclastic-rich transgressive systems tract (TST), which is bounded beneath by a transgressively modified, Glossifungites-demarcated sequence boundary (SB/RS), overlain by a molluscbearing falling-stage systems tract (FSST). The erosional downlap surface that separates the TST from the FSST is the regressive surface of marine erosion (RSME). On the footwall crests the combination of marine regressive erosion, during falls in relative sealevel, and uplift has resulted in complete removal of the sediments of the TST from these sites, leading to the formation of a tectonically enhanced basal unconformity composed of the RSME superimposed onto the previous SB/RS (SB/RS/RSME). The prominent lateral change in component units (systems tracts) and nature of bounding surfaces within the studied sequence is directly related to the presence of normal faults and indicates that fault activity had a major impact on the sequence stratigraphic evolution of the Mejillones Formation, enhancing subsidence within the grabens and promoting unconformities in the horsts. Overall, the Mejillones Formation records a long-term sea-level fall driven by the contemporaneous regional uplift, punctuated by repeated, high-frequency eustatic sea-level changes. The effect of this superimposition was that glacio-eustatic sequences were displaced progressively downward and basinward and stacked in a distinct downstepping, tectonically enhanced falling-stage sequence set, which reflects basin-wide loss in accommodation space. The sequence set is underlain by a composite RSME that becomes progressively younger basinward and is made up by the lateral and down-dip connection of a series of lower-rank sequence boundaries including hanging-wall SB/RSs and footwall SB/RS/RSMEs of successive sequences.},

Since the 1995‐Mw 8.1 Antofagasta earthquake, the mechanism driving this recent and localized extension is considered to be associated with the seismic cycle within the subduction zone. Analyzing morphotectonic patterns along these faults allows examining the seismic potential associated with the subduction zone. Using field Digital Elevation Models and in situ‐produced cosmogenic 10Be, we determined a 0.2 mm/a long‐term slip rate along the Mejillones Fault, one of the most prominent structures within the AFS. This result suggests that the AFS corresponds to slow slip rate faults despite the rapid subduction context. However, the size of coseismic slips observed along the AFS faults suggests that larger subduction earthquakes (Mw {\textgreater} 8.1) may occur episodically in the area.},

The heterogeneous pattern of interseismic coupling presumably relates to spatial variations of frictional properties along the subduction interface and may also show up in the fore-arc morphology. To investigate this hypothesis, we compiled information on the extent of earthquake ruptures for the last 500 years and uplift rates derived from dated marine terraces along the South American coastline from central Peru to southern Chile. We additionally calculated a new interseismic coupling model for that same area based on a compilation of GPS data. We show that the coastline geometry, characterized by the distance between the coast and the trench; the latitudinal variations of long-term uplift rates; and the spatial pattern of interseismic coupling are correlated. Zones of faster and long-term permanent coastal uplift, evidenced by uplifted marine terraces, coincide with peninsulas and also with areas of creep on the megathrust where slip is mostly aseismic and tend to arrest seismic ruptures. We conclude that spatial variations of frictional properties along the megathrust dictate the tectono-geomorphological evolution of the coastal zone and the extent of seismic ruptures along strike.},

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is used to detect and analyze shallow creep of two crustal faults at Mejilones Peninsula, Northern Chile, located in the hanging wall of the 2007 Mw 7.7 Tocopilla subduction earthquake. We generate two independent time series of surface deformation spanning \$ 3.5 yr of late interseismic and \$ 1.5 yr early postseismic deformation associated with this event. The analysis reveals creep on the Mejillones fault as well as on a previously unmapped fault to the west of the Mejillones fault. The InSAR deformation maps and distributed slip models obtained from the data reveal that fault creep reversed between the interseismic and postseismic periods. Given the regional stress ﬁeld perturbations due to interseismic and coseismic deformation, we argue that the observed shallow creep and its slip reversal are directly linked to the megathrust seismic cycle. Moreover, from similar eastward dips but opposite slip directions of the two faults, we infer that fault strength must be very low and that the kinematics is controlled by crustal ﬂexure associated with the seismic cycle on the underlying megathrust.},

	abstract = {The different phases of the earthquake cycle can produce measurable deformation of the Earth’s surface. This work is aimed at describing the evolution of that deformation in space and time, as well as the distribution of causal slip on the fault at depth. We have applied GPS and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) techniques to northern Chile, where fast plate convergence rates are associated with large subduction earthquakes and extensive crustal deformation. The region of northern Chile between 18◦S and 23◦S is one of the most important seismic gaps in the world, with no rupture having occurred since 1877. In 1995, the M w = 8.1 Antofagasta earthquake ruptured the subduction interface over a length of 180 km in the region immediately to the south of this 450 km long gap. The coseismic deformation associated with this event has been documented previously. Here we use GPS position timeseries for 40 benchmarks (measured between 1996 and 2000) and ERS SAR interferograms (for the interval between 1995 and 1999) to map both the post-seismic deformation following the 1995 event and the ongoing interseismic deformation in the adjacent gap region. In the seismic gap, the interseismic velocities of 20–30 mm yr−1 to the east with respect to South America are mapped. Both the GPS and the InSAR measurements can be modelled with 100 per cent coupling of the thrust interface of the subduction to a depth of 35 km, with a transition zone extending down to 55 km depth. The slip rate in that zone increases linearly from zero to the plate convergence rate. South of the gap, the interferometric map shows interseismic deformation superimposed with deformation following the 1995 earthquake and covering the same area as the coseismic deformation. Some 40 per cent of this deformation is related to seismic activity in the 3.3 yr following the 1995 event, in particular slip during a M w = 7.1 earthquake in 1998. However, most of the signal (60 per cent) corresponds to post-seismic deformation resulting from widespread aseismic slip in the subduction interface. The afterslip appears to have occurred down-dip in the transition zone at 35–55 km depth and to have propagated laterally northwards at 25–45 km depth under the Mejillones Peninsula, which is a prominent geomorphological feature at the boundary between the 1877 and 1995 rupture zones. We propose a simple slip model for the seismic cycle associated with the Antofagasta earthquake, where the transition zone alternates between aseismic shear and seismic slip.},

	abstract = {On the basis of a waveform similarity analysis, we detected 321 earthquake clusters with very similar (cross-correlation coefficient {\textgreater}0.95) waveforms on the plate boundary in the northeastern Japan subduction zone. Most of them were not found within the subducting Pacific plate with a few exceptions. Moreover, even on the plate boundary, they were not located in the large moment release areas of large interplate earthquakes that occurred recently or in the areas where the plates are inferred to be strongly coupled from GPS data analyses. These observations suggest that these similar earthquakes are caused by repeating slips of small asperities with a dimension of around 0.1 to 1 km surrounded by stable sliding areas on the plate boundary. If the aseismic slip portion in these small asperities is negligible, we can estimate the cumulative amount of aseismic slip in the area surrounding each asperity. In other words, repeating earthquake data potentially can be used to estimate the spatiotemporal aseismic slip distribution on the plate boundary. We estimated the spatial distribution of slip rate on the plate boundary from repeating earthquake data. The scaling relation between seismic moment and seismic slip by Nadeau and Johnson [1998] is used for the estimation of the slip amount by each repeating earthquake cluster. Obtained spatial distribution is consistent with that estimated from GPS data on land.},

	abstract = {We analyse radar interferometric and GPS observations of the displacement ﬁeld from the 1995 July 30 Mw = 8.1 Antofagasta, Chile, earthquake and invert for the distribution of slip along the co-seismic fault plane. Using a ﬁxed fault geometry, we compare the use of singular-value decomposition and constrained linear inversion to invert for the slip distribution and ﬁnd that the latter approach is better resolved and more physically reasonable. Separate inversions using only GPS data, only InSAR data from descending orbits, and InSAR data from both ascending and descending orbits without the GPS data illustrate the complimentary nature of GPS and the presently available InSAR data. The GPS data resolve slip near GPS benchmarks well, while the InSAR provides greater spatial sampling. The combination of ascending and descending InSAR data contributes greatly to the ability of InSAR to resolve the slip model, thereby emphasizing the need to acquire this data for future earthquakes. The rake, distribution of slip and seismic moment of our preferred model are generally consistent with previous seismic and geodetic inversions, although signiﬁcant differences do exist. GPS data projected in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) and corresponding InSAR pixels have a root mean square (rms) difference of about 3 cm. Comparison of our predictions of vertical displacement and observed uplift from corraline algae have an rms of 10 cm. Our inversion and previous results reveal that the location of slip might be inﬂuenced by the 1987 Mw = 7.5 event. Our analysis further reveals that the 1995 slip distribution was affected by a 1988 Mw = 7.2 event, and might have inﬂuenced a 1998 Mw = 7.0 earthquake that occurred downdip of the 1995 rupture. Our slip inversion reveals a potential change in mechanism in the southern portion of the rupture, consistent with seismic results. Predictions of the satellite LOS displacement from a seismic inversion and a joint seismic/GPS inversion do not compare favourably with the InSAR observations.},

	abstract = {Despite its location in a convergent tectonic setting, the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile between 21°S and 25°S is dominated by structures demonstrating extension in the direction of plate convergence. In some locations, however, normal faults have been reactivated as reverse faults, complicating the interpretation of long-term strain. In order to place these new observations in a tectonic context, we model stress changes induced on these faults by the subduction earthquake cycle. Our simulations predict that interseismic locking on the plate boundary encourages normal slip on fore-arc faults, which may result from elastic rebound due to interplate earthquakes or from seismic or aseismic motion that takes place within the interseismic period. Conversely, stress generated by strong subduction zone earthquakes, such as the 1995 Mw = 8.1 Antofagasta event, provides a mechanism for the reverse reactivation we document here. Upper plate fault slip in response to the low-magnitude stress changes induced by the subduction earthquake cycle suggests that the absolute level of stress on these faults is very low. Furthermore, seismic hazard analysis for northern Chile requires consideration of not only the plate boundary earthquake cycle but also the cycle on fore-arc faults that may or may not coincide with the interplate pattern. Though the relationships between permanent strain and deformation calculated using elastic models remain unclear, the compatibility of modeled stress fields with the distribution of fore-arc faulting suggests that interseismic strain accumulation and coseismic deformation on the subduction megathrust both play significant roles in shaping structural behavior in the upper plate.},

	abstract = {The northern Chile subduction zone constitutes a seismic gap where no great interplate earthquakes (Mw{\textgreater}8.8) have nucleated since 1877. Active normal faulting occurs conspicuously in the Coastal Forearc at the southern end of this gap, between 22.7°S and 24°S. There, upper crustal extension is present right above a suggested subduction segment boundary of the Nazca-South America interplate contact. In this work, by using Coulomb Failure Stress Change (CFS) models, we explore the effects of coseismic and interseismic stages of the subduction earthquake cycle on the reactivation of pre-existing upper plate normal faults in this area. We attempt to unravel the first-order interplate conditions required to explain this extensional pattern, putting specific focus on the influence of the megathrust segmentation defined by the Mejillones Peninsula. It is suggested that the restricted occurrence of active normal faulting in the study area is tightly related to the structure of the interplate seismogenic zone. Positive CFS values are induced in the study area by the coseismic and interseismic stages of the subduction earthquake cycle, in a region characterized by lower coupling beneath the Mejillones Peninsula. We propose that fault reactivation in this zone is particularly favored during the coseismic stage by earthquakes occurring offshore of the Mejillones Peninsula and surrounding areas. In the adjacent subduction segments, coseismic and interseismic CFS values tend to counterbalance each other, resulting in no tensional conditions capable to cause normal fault reactivation. We suggest that the coupling variation in the seismogenic zone is long term controlled by the geological structure of the upper plate.},

	abstract = {New neotectonic observations, along with a detailed aerial photograph analysis, allow a new interpretation of the recent tectonic behaviour of the outer forearc in northern Chile between 22.5°S and 24.5°S (Antofagasta region). Both the Coastal Cordillera and the Mejillones Peninsula are under E-W extension. Normal faults dipping east with an almost N-S orientation are predominant. Large-scale Neogene to Recent deformation is characterized by vertical uplift and subsidence related to normal faulting. Recent kinematics along the Atacama Fault System, including the Atacama Fault itself, are controlled by the regional extensional stress regime, and the predominant component of recent displacement along the Atacama Fault is vertical (normal). However, strike-slip components are also observed, but with moderate offsets, no larger than one to two tens of metres. The sense of shear, and the ratio between vertical and horizontal offsets, vary coherently with the fault azimuth, compatible with E-W extension. Oblique-slip faulting, with normal and left-lateral offsets of similar amplitude, is observed on the most northeasterly oriented segment of the Atacama Fault. This small left-lateral component of displacement and the strike-slip motion predicted by models of strain partitioning of the convergence along the Atacama Fault are in opposite senses. This occurs because the stress regime in the coastal region is not compressional but extensional. Very fresh recent ruptures are numerous, especially between 23°S and 24°S, and provide clear indications of the occurrence of moderate to large continental earthquakes during the Late Quaternary. As pointed out by several authors, indirect lines of evidence suggest active subduction erosion and underplating along the margin of northern Chile. We propose that part of the long-term extension is due to the broad-scale flexure of the outer forearc. This flexure may be controlled by offshore subsidence caused by subduction erosion near the trench, and by onshore uplift related to the underplating of eroded low-density material beneath the Coastal Cordillera. Neotectonic observations show that the state of stress in the outer forearc remains extensional (in a deviatoric sense) in the long term. However, it is proposed that the state of stress has a strong time-dependent component, which is intimately linked to the subduction seismic cycle. The Mw=8.0 Antofagasta earthquake of 1995 July 30 showed that large subduction earthquakes produce E-W extension in the coastal region. The overall E-W deviatoric extension in the outer forearc should be reduced by interseismic contraction in the period separating two subduction earthquakes. This reduction means that continental faults will remain locked and aseismic in the interseismic period of the subduction cycle, in agreement with microseismic observations, which indicate an absence of shallow crustal seismicity. We assume that the amount of extension produced by subduction earthquakes in the coastal area is larger than the cumulative interseismic contraction. This occurs because the displacement field generated by subduction earthquakes is concentrated in the outer forearc. The E-W extension should grow over prepeated subduction seismic cycles and lead to large continental earthquakes occurring within the overriding block, simultaneous with large subduction events. We show new surface ruptures associated with normal faulting along the Atacama Fault, which were most probably triggered by the 1995 Antofagasta subduction earthquake.},

	abstract = {An Mw = 8.0 earthquake occurred on 30 July 1995 in the Antofagasta region (northern Chile). The main rupture, corresponding to thrust faulting, developed from 10 to 50 km in depth along the subduction interface between the Nazca and the South American plates. The 1995 earthquake took place just south of the large seismic gap where a great earthquake (M = 9) had occurred in 1877. Most of the 1995 rupture was located within a local network consisting of nine short-period stations that had been previously installed at the southern end of the 1877 gap, and the aftershock sequence could be accurately monitored.

A tsunami wave, 2 to 2.5 m high, was observed along the coast from Mejillones to Taltal. One strong foreshock (Mw = 6.2) occurred in the 1995 hypocentral region 6 months before the main event.Body-wave modeling of broadband seismograms from the global network, along with the analysis of the aftershock distribution, allows us to propose a well-constrained model for the whole rupture process. Some additional details of the rupture were obtained from an accelerometer record at Antofagasta. The main rupture started as a double even with thrust mechanism below the southern part of the Mejillones peninsula, and it propagated southward in a N200°E direction with an average velocity of 2.8 km/sec. It ended near the trench in normal faulting. The total rupture area and seismic moment are 185 × 90 km2 and 1.2 × 1028 dyne-cm, respectively. The aftershock distribution delineates a well-defined rupture surface along the subduction interface. The distribution of epicenters during the first 20 h of aftershock activity shows a sharp northern boundary beneath the Mejillones peninsula. Hence, the 1995 main rupture did not propagate north of the Mejillones peninsula into the 1877 gap. Aftershocks during the following 2 weeks indicate a growth of the initial rupture zone toward the north. The mechanisms of the strongest aftershocks are similar to that of the mainshock. The down-dip termination of the main rupture corresponds to the maximum depth (50 km) of the region that had been identified as the locked part of the subduction interface from the analysis of the microseismicity recorded by the local network prior to the 1995 event.A well-constrained dislocation model is proposed for the 1995 main rupture, which produces surface displacements in good agreement with available observations of coastal uplift and GPS measurements. The dislocation model, as well as Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, indicate that the 1995 earthquake generated E-W extension in the coastal region of Antofagasta. The Atacama fault, located 40 to 50 km above the 1995 main rupture, showed small fresh surface ruptures near Sierra Remiendos (70 km to the SSE of Antofagasta) with a maximum vertical offset of 20 cm. This offset corresponds to normal faulting, which is in agreement with the E-W co-seismic extension.The Mejillones peninsula appears to be the surface expression of a barrier that interrupted the propagation of the 1995 rupture to the north into the region of the 1877 gap. Modeling of static stress changes induced by the Antofagasta earthquake indicates an increase in compressive stresses along a direction transverse to the trench immediately to the north of the 1995 rupture surface. Thus, the chances for the reactivation of the 1877 gap after this event are greater now.},

We use synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) to search for small-scale coseismic and postseismic deformation on individual faults. The InSAR data are ambiguous: some images show offset consistent with coseismic faulting on the Paposo segment of the AFS and others lack such signal. The fact that we do not observe the fault-like displacement in all coseismic interferograms suggests that atmospheric contamination, not tectonic deformation, is responsible for the signal. To explore the capacity of the earthquake to trigger motion on upper plate faults, we use seven published slip maps constrained by geodetic and/or seismic data to calculate static and dynamic Coulomb stress change (CSC) on faults in the Antofagasta region. The static CSC field varies between models and depends on the distribution of coseismic interplate slip. On the basis of the CSC distribution predicted by our preferred model constrained by all available data, we suggest it was unlikely that the Antofagasta earthquake directly triggered normal motion on the AFS, and the InSAR data are consistent with this null result. Field reports of normal faulting related to the earthquake may reflect recent (but not coseismic) motion or highly localized behavior not representative of the regional coseismic stress field.},

	abstract = {Time series analysis of InSAR data has emerged as an important tool for monitoring and measuring the displacement of the Earth’s surface. Changes in the Earth’s surface can result from a wide range of phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, variations in ground water levels, and changes in wetland water levels. Time series analysis is applied to interferometric phase measurements, which wrap around when the observed motion is larger than one-half of the radar wavelength. Thus, the spatio-temporal “unwrapping” of phase observations is necessary to obtain physically meaningful results. Several different algorithms have been developed for time series analysis of InSAR data to solve for this ambiguity. These algorithms may employ different models for time series analysis, but they all generate a first-order deformation rate, which can be compared to each other. However, there is no single algorithm that can provide optimal results in all cases. Since time series analyses of InSAR data are used in a variety of applications with different characteristics, each algorithm possesses inherently unique strengths and weaknesses. In this review article, following a brief overview of InSAR technology, we discuss several algorithms developed for time series analysis of InSAR data using an example set of results for measuring subsidence rates in Mexico City.},

	abstract = {Lago Laja is a late Quaternary volcanic-dammed lake located near the drainage divide of the south central Andes. Field observations, lake reflection seismic profiles, bathymetry, and remote sensing data reveal an active fault system that runs parallel to the volcanic arc along the axis of the Main Cordillera, the Lago Laja fault system (LLFS). Normal faults of this extensional system cut late Pleistocene volcanics, {\textless}7.1 ka still water lacustrine sediments, 6.3 ka pyroclastic deposits, and Holocene alluvial fans. We divide the LLFS in three segments on the basis of fault geometry, width, and slip magnitude. The underwater faults of the central segment in the lake's deepest part have the maximum Holocene vertical slip rate of {\textgreater}2.7 mm/yr. Since 7.1 ka, the LLFS accounts for ∼0.7\% of arc-normal extension at an average minimum rate of 1.2 mm/yr and strain rate of ∼10−14 s−1. Seismites and surface ruptures evidence M{\textgreater}6 paleoearthquakes. The Main Cordillera at ∼37°S is a large-scale pop-up structure uplifted by thrusting along its foothills. In this light, we interpret extension in the axial and highest part of the Andes as incipient synorogenic gravitational collapse in response to uplift and crustal thickening. Thermal weakening due to elevated heat flow and postglacial lithospheric rebound and unbending have probably contributed to the arc-limited collapse and Holocene acceleration of deformation rates. The lack of significant strike-slip offsets along the LLFS as well as along both foothills-thrust systems at 37°S contrasts with the intra-arc dextral fault zone south of 38°S. Regional structural data indicates that north of 38°S, diffusely distributed strain reflects low partitioning of oblique subduction, while to the south deformation is localized in a discrete strike-slip fault zone along the volcanic arc, reflecting a higher degree of partitioning. We relate this strain partitioning gradient to favorable fault orientations in the fore arc north of the Arauco Peninsula, a major seismotectonic boundary.},

	abstract = {Geophysical applications of radar interferometry to measure changes in the Earth's surface have exploded in the early 1990s. This new geodetic technique calculates the interference pattern caused by the difference in phase between two images acquired by a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar at two distinct times. The resulting interferogram is a contour map of the change in distance between the ground and the radar instrument. These maps provide an unsurpassed spatial sampling density (∼100 pixels km−2), a competitive precision (∼1 cm), and a useful observation cadence (1 pass month−1). They record movements in the crust, perturbations in the atmosphere, dielectric modifications in the soil, and relief in the topography. They are also sensitive to technical effects, such as relative variations in the radar's trajectory or variations in its frequency standard. We describe how all these phenomena contribute to an interferogram. Then a practical summary explains the techniques for calculating and manipulating interferograms from various radar instruments, including the four satellites currently in orbit: ERS-1, ERS-2, JERS-1, and RADARSAT. The next chapter suggests some guidelines for interpreting an interferogram as a geophysical measurement: respecting the limits of the technique, assessing its uncertainty, recognizing artifacts, and discriminating different types of signal. We then review the geophysical applications published to date, most of which study deformation related to earthquakes, volcanoes, and glaciers using ERS-1 data. We also show examples of monitoring natural hazards and environmental alterations related to landslides, subsidence, and agriculture. In addition, we consider subtler geophysical signals such as postseismic relaxation, tidal loading of coastal areas, and interseismic strain accumulation. We conclude with our perspectives on the future of radar interferometry. The objective of the review is for the reader to develop the physical understanding necessary to calculate an interferogram and the geophysical intuition necessary to interpret it.},

	abstract = {This book is the product of five and a half years of research dedicated to the und- standing of radar interferometry, a relatively new space-geodetic technique for m- suring the earth’s topography and its deformation. The main reason for undertaking this work, early 1995, was the fact that this technique proved to be extremely useful for wide-scale, fine-resolution deformation measurements. Especially the interf- ometric products from the ERS-1 satellite provided beautiful first results—several interferometric images appeared as highlights on the cover of journals such as Nature and Science. Accuracies of a few millimeters in the radar line of sight were claimed in semi-continuous image data acquired globally, irrespective of cloud cover or solar illumination. Unfortunately, because of the relative lack of supportive observations at these resolutions and accuracies, validation of the precision and reliability of the results remained an issue of concern. From a geodetic point of view, several survey techniques are commonly available to measure a specific geophysical phenomenon. To make an optimal choice between these techniques it is important to have a uniform and quantitative approach for describing the errors and how these errors propagate to the estimated parameters. In this context, the research described in this book was initiated. It describes issues involved with different types of errors, induced by the sensor, the data processing, satellite positioning accuracy, atmospheric propagation, and scattering character- tics. Nevertheless, as the first item in the subtitle “Data Interpretation and Error Analysis” suggests, data interpretation is not always straightforward.},

	abstract = {We quantify the bias and uncertainty of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) displacement time series and their derivatives, the displacement velocities, by analyzing the systematic and stochastic components of the temporal variation of the tropospheric delay. The biases due to the systematic seasonal delay depend on the SAR acquisition times, whereas the uncertainties depend on the standard deviation of the random delay, the number of acquisitions, the total time span covered, and the covariance of the time series of the stochastic delay between a pixel and the reference. We study the contribution of the wet delay to the InSAR observations along the western India plate boundary using (i) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer precipitable water vapor, (ii) stratified tropospheric delay estimated from the ERA-I global atmospheric model, and (iii) seven Envisat InSAR swaths. Our analysis indicates that the amplitudes of the annual delay vary by up to 10 cm in this region equivalent to a maximum displacement bias of 24 cm in InSAR line of sight direction between two epochs (assuming Envisat IS6 beam mode). The stratified tropospheric delay correction mitigates this bias and reduces the scatter due to the stochastic delay. For 7 years of Envisat acquisitions along the western India plate boundary, the uncertainty of the InSAR velocity field due to the residual stochastic wet delay after stratified tropospheric delay correction using the ERA-I model is in the order of 2 mm/yr over 100 km and 4 mm/yr over 400 km. We discuss the implication of the derived uncertainties on the full variance-covariance matrix of the InSAR data.},

The dispersive character of the ionosphere at microwave frequencies allows one to estimate the ionospheric delay from InSAR data through a split range-spectrum technique. Here, we extend the existing split range-spectrum technique to InSAR time-series. We present an algorithm for estimating a time-series of ionospheric phase delay that is useful for correcting InSAR time-series of ground surface displacement or for evaluating the spatial and temporal variations of the ionosphere’s total electron content (TEC). Experimental results from stacks of L-band SAR data acquired by the ALOS-1 Japanese satellite show signiﬁcant ionospheric phase delay equivalent to 2 m of the temporal variation of InSAR time-series along 445 km in Chile, a region at low latitudes where large TEC variations are common. The observed delay is signiﬁcantly smaller, with a maximum of 10 cm over 160 km, in California. The estimation and correction of ionospheric delay reduces the temporal variation of the InSAR time-series to centimeter levels in Chile. The ionospheric delay correction of the InSAR time-series reveals earthquake-induced ground displacement, which otherwise could not be detected. A comparison with independent GPS time-series demonstrates an order of magnitude reduction in the root mean square difference between GPS and InSAR after correcting for ionospheric delay. The results show that the presented algorithm signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of InSAR time-series and should become a routine component of InSAR time-series analysis.},

Subduction zones are responsible for the most-damaging and tsunami-generating great earthquakes.

The new model, Slab2, details the geometry of 24 million square kilometers of subducted slabs, from ocean trench to upper mantle. The model will be vital for fully understanding seismic hazard in some of the most populated regions in the world.
Science, this issue p. 58
Subduction zones are home to the most seismically active faults on the planet. The shallow megathrust interfaces of subduction zones host Earth’s largest earthquakes and are likely the only faults capable of magnitude 9+ ruptures. Despite these facts, our knowledge of subduction zone geometry—which likely plays a key role in determining the spatial extent and ultimately the size of subduction zone earthquakes—is incomplete. We calculated the three-dimensional geometries of all seismically active global subduction zones. The resulting model, called Slab2, provides a uniform geometrical analysis of all currently subducting slabs.
Slab2 is a comprehensive model of all seismically active subduction zones on Earth.

However, geodetic measurements conducted over the last decade in this area show that the upper plate is actually deforming, which reveals some degree of locking on the subduction interface. This accumulation of elastic deformation is likely to be released in a future earthquake. Because of the long elapsed time since 1877 and the rapid accumulation of deformation (thought to be 6–7 cm yr−1), many consider this area is a mature seismic gap where a major earthquake is due and seismic hazard is high. We present a new Global Positioning System (GPS) velocity ﬁeld, acquired between 2008 and 2012, that describes in some detail the interseismic deformation between 18◦S and 24◦S. We invert for coupling distribution on the Nazca-South America subduction interface using elastic modelling. Our measurements require that, at these latitudes, 10 to 12 mm yr−1 (i.e. 15 per cent of the whole convergence rate) are accommodated by the clockwise rotation of an Andean block bounded to the East by the subandean fold-and-thrust belt. This reduces the accumulation rate on the subduction interface to 56 mm yr−1 in this area. Coupling variations on the subduction interface both along-strike and along-dip are described. We ﬁnd that the North Chile seismic gap is segmented in at least two highly locked segments bounded by narrow areas of weak coupling. This coupling segmentation is consistent with our knowledge of the historical ruptures and of the instrumental seismicity of the region. Intersegment zones (Iquique, Mejillones) correlate with high background seismic rate and local tectonic complexities on the upper or downgoing plates. The rupture of either the Paranal or the Loa segment alone could easily produce a Mw 8.0–8.3 rupture, and we propose that the Loa segment (from 22.5◦S to 20.8◦S) may be the one that ruptured in 1877.},

	abstract = {The recent expansion of dense GPS networks over plate boundaries allows for remarkably precise mapping of interseismic coupling along active faults. The interseismic coupling coefﬁcient is related to the ratio between slipping velocity on the fault during the interseismic period and the long-term plates velocity, but the interpretation of coupling in terms of mechanical behavior of the fault is still unclear. Here, we investigate the link between coupling and seismicity over the Chilean subduction zone that ruptured three times in the last 5 years with major earthquakes (Maule Mw 8.8 in 2010, Iquique Mw 8.1 in 2014 and Illapel Mw 8.4 in 2015). We combine recent GPS data acquired over the margin (38°–18°S) with older data to get the ﬁrst nearly continuous picture of the interseismic coupling variations on the subduction interface. Here, we show that at least six low coupling zones (LCZ), areas where coupling is low relatively to the neighboring highly coupled segments can be identiﬁed. We also ﬁnd that for the three most recent Mw[8 events, coseismic asperities correlate well with highly coupled segments, while LCZs behaved as barriers and stopped the ruptures. The relation between coupling and background seismicity in the interseismic period before the events is less clear. However, we note that swarm sequences are prone to occur in intermediate coupling areas at the transition between LCZ and neighboring segments, and that the background seismicity tends to concentrate on the downdip part of the seismogenic locked zone. Thus, highly coupled segments usually exhibit low background seismicity. In this overall context, the Metropolitan segment that partly ruptured during the 2015 Illapel earthquake appears as an outlier since both coupling and background seismicity were high before the rupture, raising the issue of the remaining seismic hazard in this very densely populated area.},

The data show complex patterns in continental wedge geometry that challenge the most frequently used classification methodology for the convergent margin tectonics. A detailed modeling of the parameters involved in the Non-Cohesive Coulomb Wedge theory reveals a tectonic latitudinal segmentation of the Chilean offshore subduction zone. This segmentation is characterized by a sequence of broad segments with different basal effective friction coefficient and/or internal fluid pressure conditions, which are limited by the presence of bathymetric oceanic highs, fracture zones and Peninsulas. The results suggest a general increase of the fluid pressure inside the continental wedge north of 33°S, which is interpreted as a result of a more pervasive fracturing due to tectonic erosion at the base and within the continental wedge. The tectonic segmentation proposed here shows a close spatial relation with the short-term deformation process associated to the coseismic ruptures of large earthquakes in the Chilean margin.},

	abstract = {The Mejillonia terrane, named after the Mejillones Peninsula (northern Chile), has been traditionally considered an early Paleozoic block of metamorphic and igneous rocks displaced along the northern Andean margin in the Mesozoic. However, U–Pb SHRIMP zircon dating of metasedimentary and igneous rocks shows that the sedimentary protoliths were Triassic, and that metamorphism and magmatism took place in the Late Triassic (Norian). Field evidence combined with zircon dating (detrital and metamorphic) further suggests that the sedimentary protoliths were buried, deformed (foliated and folded) and metamorphosed very rapidly, probably within few million years, at ca. 210Ma. The metasedimentary wedge was then uplifted and intruded by a late arc-related tonalite body (Morro Mejillones) at 208±2Ma, only a short time after the peak of metamorphism. The Mejillones metamorphic and igneous basement represents an accretionary wedge or marginal basin that underwent contractional deformation and metamorphism at the end of a Late Permian to Late Triassic anorogenic episode that is well known in Chile and Argentina. Renewal of subduction along the pre-Andean continental margin in the Late Triassic and the development of new subduction-related magmatism are probably represented by the Early Jurassic Bólfin–Punta Tetas magmatic arc in the southern part of the peninsula, for which an age of 184±1Ma was determined. We suggest retaining the classification of Mejillonia as a tectonostratigraphic terrane, albeit in this new context.},

The relative angular velocities of 25 plates constitute the MORVEL set of geologically current relative plate angular velocities; the relative angular velocities of the other 31 plates are adapted from Bird (2003). NNR-MORVEL, a set of angular velocities of the 25 MORVEL plates relative to the no-net rotation reference frame, is also determined. Incorporating the 31 plates from Bird (2003), which constitute 2.8\% of Earth's surface, changes the angular velocities of the MORVEL plates in the no-net-rotation frame only insignificantly, but provides a more complete description of globally distributed deformation and strain rate. NNR-MORVEL56 differs significantly from, and improves upon, NNR-NUVEL1A, our prior set of angular velocities of the plates relative to the no-net-rotation reference frame, partly due to differences in angular velocity at two essential links of the MORVEL plate circuit, Antarctica-Pacific and Nubia-Antarctica, and partly due to differences in the angular velocities of the Philippine Sea, Nazca, and Cocos plates relative to the Pacific plate. For example, the NNR-MORVEL56 Pacific angular velocity differs from the NNR-NUVEL1A angular velocity by a vector of length 0.039 ± 0.011° a−1 (95\% confidence limits), resulting in a root-mean-square difference in velocity of 2.8 mm a−1.

In a single area, we document a complex mosaic of phenomena including large earthquakes, postseismic afterslip with a spatial distribution that appears to be tied to variations in coastal morphology, and a completely aseismic pulse that may have triggered a Mw 7.1 earthquake on 30 January 1998. In contrast to simple models of fault slip behavior, this spatial heterogeneity indicates that frictional parameters on the fault do not have a systematic transition with depth and also vary rapidly along strike. The low amount of afterslip from the Mw 8.1 earthquake relative to other similar events suggests that postseismic behavior may be modulated by the amount of sediment subducted.},

	abstract = {The estimation of finite fault earthquake source models is an inherently underdetermined problem: there is no unique solution to the inverse problem of determining the rupture history at depth as a function of time and space when our data are limited to observations at the Earth's surface. Bayesian methods allow us to determine the set of all plausible source model parameters that are consistent with the observations, our a priori assumptions about the physics of the earthquake source and wave propagation, and models for the observation errors and the errors due to the limitations in our forward model. Because our inversion approach does not require inverting any matrices other than covariance matrices, we can restrict our ensemble of solutions to only those models that are physically defensible while avoiding the need to restrict our class of models based on considerations of numerical invertibility. We only use prior information that is consistent with the physics of the problem rather than some artefice (such as smoothing) needed to produce a unique optimal model estimate. Bayesian inference can also be used to estimate model-dependent and internally consistent effective errors due to shortcomings in the forward model or data interpretation, such as poor Green's functions or extraneous signals recorded by our instruments. Until recently, Bayesian techniques have been of limited utility for earthquake source inversions because they are computationally intractable for problems with as many free parameters as typically used in kinematic finite fault models. Our algorithm, called cascading adaptive transitional metropolis in parallel (CATMIP), allows sampling of high-dimensional problems in a parallel computing framework. CATMIP combines the Metropolis algorithm with elements of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to dynamically optimize the algorithm's efficiency as it runs. The algorithm is a generic Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler; it works independently of the model design, a priori constraints and data under consideration, and so can be used for a wide variety of scientific problems. We compare CATMIP's efficiency relative to several existing sampling algorithms and then present synthetic performance tests of finite fault earthquake rupture models computed using CATMIP.},

We have applied the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique to obtain new insights into the present-day deformation pattern of the frontal area of the Northern Apennine. PSI has proved to be effective in detecting surface deformation of wide regions involved in low tectonic movements. We used 34 Envisat images in descending geometry over the period of time between 2004 and 2010, performing about 300 interferometric pairs. The analysis of the velocity maps and of the PSI time-series has allowed to observe ground deformation over the sector of the Po Plain between Piacenza and Reggio Emilia. The time-series of permanent GPS stations located in the study area, validated the results of the PSI technique, showing a good correlation with the PS time-series. The PS analysis reveals the occurrence of a well-known subsidence area on the rear of the Ferrara arc, mostly connected to the exploitation of water resources. In some instances, the PS velocity pattern reveals ground uplift (with mean velocities ranging from 1 to 2.8 mm yr−1) above active thrust-related anticlines of the Emilia and Ferrara folds, and part of the Pede-Apennine margin. We hypothesize a correlation between the observed uplift deformation pattern and the growth of the thrust-related anticlines. As the uplift pattern corresponds to known geological features, it can be used to constrain the seismo-tectonic setting, and a working hypothesis may involve that the active Emilia and Ferrara thrust folds would be characterized by interseismic periods possibly dominated by aseismic creep.},

However, it appears likely that at the longest timescale, rates slowed over time, from 1.0 to 1.4 mm/yr between 10 and 6 Ma to 0.2 to 0.3 mm/yr since 6 Ma. The cumulative vertical displacement record across all three faults also shows time-variable strain release ranging from 2 to 4 mm/yr since 10 ka to {\textless}1 mm/yr averaged over the past 130 kyr. Conventional earthquake recurrence models (“Reid-type” behavior) would require an accordingly large variation in strain accumulation or loading rate on a 10-kyr timescale, for which there appears to be no obvious geophysical explanation. Alternatively, seismic strain release, given a wide range of plausible constitutive behaviors for frictional sliding, may be clustered on the 10-kyr timescale, resulting in the high Holocene rates, with comparatively low, uniform strain accumulation rates on the 100-kyr timescale (“Wallace-type” behavior). The latter alternative, combined with observations at the million-year timescale and the likelihood of a significant contribution of postseismic transients, implies maxima of spectral amplitude in the velocity field at periods of ∼10 Myr (variations in tectonic loading), ∼10 kyr (clustered strain release), and of 100 years (postseismic transients). If so, measurements of strain accumulation and strain release may be strongly timescale-dependent for any given fault system.},

	abstract = {Microwave signals traveling through the troposphere are subject to delays. These delays are mainly described by spatial and temporal variations in pressure, temperature, and relative humidity in the lower part of the troposphere, resulting in a spatially varying tropospheric signal in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Tropospheric correction techniques rely either on external data, often limited by spatial and temporal accuracy or can be estimated from the high-resolution interferometric phase itself. However, current phase-estimated correction techniques do not account for the spatial variability of the tropospheric properties and fail to capture tropospheric signals over larger regions. Here we propose and test a novel power law correction method that accounts for spatial variability in atmospheric properties and can be applied to interferograms containing topographically correlated deformation. The power law model has its reference ﬁxed at the relative top of the troposphere and describes, through a power law relationship, how the phase delay varies with altitude. We ﬁnd the power law model reduces tropospheric signals both locally (on average by ∼0.45 cm for each kilometer of elevation in Mexico) and the long-wavelength components, leading to an improved ﬁt to independent Global Navigation Satellite Systems data. The power law model can be applied in presence of deformation, over a range of diﬀerent time periods and in diﬀerent atmospheric conditions, and thus permits the detection of smaller-magnitude crustal deformation signals with InSAR.},

Observations from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) allow us to model slip at depth with a higher spatial resolution than when using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) alone. While the temporal resolution of InSAR has typically been limited, the recent ﬂeet of SAR satellites including Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMED, and RADARSAT-2 permits the use of InSAR for time-dependent slip modeling at intervals of a few days when combined. With the vast amount of SAR data available, simultaneous data inversion of all epochs becomes challenging. Here we expanded the original network inversion ﬁlter to include InSAR observations of surface displacements in addition to GNSS. In the Network Inversion Filter (NIF) framework, geodetic observations are limited to those of a given epoch, with a stochastic model describing slip evolution over time. The combination of the Kalman forward ﬁltering and backward smoothing allows all geodetic observations to constrain the complete observation period. Combining GNSS and InSAR allows modeling of time-dependent slip at unprecedented spatial resolution. We validate the approach with a simulation of the 2006 Guerrero slow slip event. We highlight the importance of including InSAR covariance information and demonstrate that InSAR provides an additional constraint on the spatial extent of the slow slip.},

This event was captured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1A radar satellite, which provide the potential to determine the fault plane, as well as the co-seismic slip distribution, and understand future seismic hazards. However, due to the limited magnitude of surface displacements and the strong topography variations, InSAR-derived co-seismic signals are contaminated by strong tropospheric effects which makes it difﬁcult (if not impossible) to determine the source parameters and co-seismic slip distribution. In this paper, we employ the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) to generate correction maps for the co-seismic interferograms, and successfully extract co-seismic surface displacements for this large event. The phase standard deviation after correction for a seriously-contaminated interferogram reaches 0.8 cm, signiﬁcantly improved from the traditional phase correlation analysis (1.13 cm) or bilinear interpolation (1.28 cm) methods. Our best model suggests that the seismogenic fault is a NW–SE striking back-thrust fault with a right-lateral strike slip component. This reﬂects the strain partitioning of NE shortening and eastward movement of the Eastern Tibetan plateau due to the oblique convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates.},

When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy. ERS data have been used.},

	abstract = {Strain accumulation and release at a subduction zone are attributed to stick slip on the main thrust zone and steady aseismic slip on the remainder of the plate interface. This process can be described as a superposition of steady state subduction and a repetitive cycle of slip on the main thrust zone, consisting of steady normal slip at the plate convergence rate plus occasional thrust events that recover the accumulated normal slip. Because steady state subduction does not contribute to the deformation at the free surface, deformation observed there is completely equivalent to that produced by the slip cycle alone. The response to that slip is simply the response of a particular earth model to embedded dislocations. For a purely elastic earth model, the deformation cycle consists of a coseismic offset followed by a linear-in-time recovery to the initial value during the interval between earthquakes. For an elastic-viscoelastic earth model (elastic lithosphere over a viscoelastic asthenosphere), the postearthquake recovery is not linear in time. Records of local uplift as a function of time indicate that the long-term postseismic recovery is approximately linear, suggesting that elastic earth models are adequate to describe the deformation cycle. However, the deformation predicted for a simple elastic half-space earth model does not reproduce the deformation observed along the subduction zones in Japan at all well if stick slip is restricted to the main thrust zone. As recognized earlier by Shimazaki, Seno, and Kato, the uplift profiles could be explained if stick slip were postulated to extend along the plate interface beyond the main thrust zone to a depth of perhaps 100 km, but independent evidence suggests that stick slip at such depths is unlikely.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents numerical models of crustal deformation in seismic zones. The chapter investigates the features of a simple model of the surface deformation that accompanies faulting on an infinitely long, vertical, strike-slip fault embedded in an elastic half-space. The physical concept of the model presented is the representation of fault slip as a solid-state “dislocation” and a key mathematical feature is the use of Green's functions for solving differential equations. The chapter focuses on the two major “deep” mechanisms of postseismic deformation—viscoelastic flow at depth and fault creep below the seismically locked layer. Because models of postseismic rebound necessarily deal with time dependent processes, they are a natural springboard to considering the entire earthquake cycle. Most of the models reviewed in the chapter are kinematic in the sense that slip is imposed on a fault either to represent actual fault slip or as a mathematical artifact to represent interseismic loading.},

	abstract = {We describe and present a new model of global subduction zone geometries, called Slab1.0. An extension of previous efforts to constrain the two-dimensional non-planar geometry of subduction zones around the focus of large earthquakes, Slab1.0 describes the detailed, non-planar, three-dimensional geometry of approximately 85\% of subduction zones worldwide. While the model focuses on the detailed form of each slab from their trenches through the seismogenic zone, where it combines data sets from active source and passive seismology, it also continues to the limits of their seismic extent in the upper-mid mantle, providing a uniform approach to the definition of the entire seismically active slab geometry. Examples are shown for two well-constrained global locations; models for many other regions are available and can be freely downloaded in several formats from our new Slab1.0 website, http://on.doi.gov/d9ARbS. We describe improvements in our two-dimensional geometry constraint inversion, including the use of ‘average’ active source seismic data profiles in the shallow trench regions where data are otherwise lacking, derived from the interpolation between other active source seismic data along-strike in the same subduction zone. We include several analyses of the uncertainty and robustness of our three-dimensional interpolation methods. In addition, we use the filtered, subduction-related earthquake data sets compiled to build Slab1.0 in a reassessment of previous analyses of the deep limit of the thrust interface seismogenic zone for all subduction zones included in our global model thus far, concluding that the width of these seismogenic zones is on average 30\% larger than previous studies have suggested.},

	abstract = {The 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikōura earthquake represents an extremely complex event involving over ten major crustal faults, altering conventional understanding of multi-fault ruptures. Although evidence for coseismic slip on the Hikurangi subduction interface is controversial, we present afterslip on the subduction zone beneath Marlborough using 13 months of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. The spatially and temporally correlated atmospheric errors in SAR interferograms are problematic, and hence a new InSAR time series approach, combining the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) with a spatial-temporal Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) filter to facilitate the InSAR time series analysis, is developed. For interferograms with over 250 km spatial extent, we achieve a 0.77 cm displacement RMS difference against GPS, improving 61\% from the conventional InSAR time series method (TS). Comparisons between the overlapping region of two independent tracks show an RMS difference of 1.1 cm for the TS-GACOS-APS combined method, improving 54\% from the TS method and 27\% from using TS with an APS filter only. The APS filter reduces the short wavelength residuals substantially, but fails to remove the long wavelength error even after the ramp removal, revealing that the GACOS correction has played a key role in mitigating long wavelength atmospheric effects. The resultant InSAR displacements, together with the GPS displacements, are used to recover the time-dependent afterslip distribution on the Hikurangi subduction interface, which provides insights for reviewing the co-seismic slip sources, the present status of the subduction plate boundary and future seismic hazards.},

This poses more challenges for correcting interferograms for atmospheric effects since the spatial-temporal variations of tropospheric delay may dominate over large scales and completely mask the actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. To overcome this, we have developed a generic interferometric synthetic aperture radar atmospheric correction model whose notable features comprise (i) global coverage, (ii) all-weather, all-time useability, (iii) correction maps available in near real time, and (iv) indicators to assess the correction performance and feasibility. The model integrates operational high-resolution European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data (0.125° grid, 137 vertical levels, and 6-hr interval) and continuous GPS tropospheric delay estimates (every 5 min) using an iterative tropospheric decomposition model. The model's performance was tested using eight globally distributed Sentinel-1 interferograms, encompassing both flat and mountainous topographies, midlatitude and near polar regions, and monsoon and oceanic climate systems, achieving a phase standard deviation and displacement root-mean-square (RMS) of 1 cm against GPS over wide regions (250 by 250 km). Indicators describing the model's performance including (i) GPS network and ECMWF cross RMS, (ii) phase versus estimated atmospheric delay correlations, (iii) ECMWF time differences, and (iv) topography variations were developed to provide quality control for subsequent automatic processing and provide insights of the confidence level with which the generated atmospheric correction maps may be applied.},

	abstract = {—In order to study both the interplate seismic loading cycle and the distribution of intraplate deformation of the Andes, a 215 site GPS network covering Chile and the western part of Argentina was selected, monumented and observed in 1993 and 1994. A dense part of the network in northern Chile and northwest Argentina, comprising some 70 sites, was re-observed after two years in October/November, 1995. The Mw= 8.0 Antofagasta (North Chile) earthquake of 30th July, 1995 took place between the two observations. The city of Antofagasta shifted 80 cm westwards by this event and the displacement still reached 10 cm at locations 300 km from the trench. Three different deformation processes have been considered for modeling the measured displacements (1) interseismic accumulation of elastic strain due to subduction coupling, (2) coseismic strain release during the Antofagasta earthquake and (3) crustal shortening in the Sub-Andes.¶Eastward displacement of the sites to the north and to the south of the area affected by the earthquake is due to the interseismic accumulation of elastic deformation. Assuming a uniform slip model of interseismic coupling, the observed displacements at the coast require a fully locked subduction interface and a depth of seismic coupling of 50 km. The geodetically derived fault plane parameters of the Antofagasta earthquake are consistent with results derived from wave-form modeling of seismolog ical data. The coseismic slip predicted by the variable slip model reaches values of 3.2 m in the dip-slip and 1.4 m in the strike-slip directions. The derived rake is 66°. Our geodetic results suggest that the oblique Nazca–South American plate convergence is accommodated by oblique earthquake slip with no slip partitioning. The observed displacements in the back-arc indicate a present-day crustal shortening rate of 3–4 mm/year which is significantly slower than the average of 10 mm/year experienced during the evolution of the Andean plateau.},

However, it has not been determined whether these products can improve the accuracy of InSAR deformation monitoring. In this paper, GACOS products were used to correct atmospheric errors in short baseline subset (SBAS)-InSAR. Southern California in the U.S. was selected as the research area, and the effect of GACOS-based SBAS-InSAR was analyzed by comparing with classical SBAS-InSAR results and external global positioning system (GPS) data. The results showed that the accuracy of deformation monitoring was improved in the whole study area after GACOS correction, and the mean square error decreased from 0.34 cm/a to 0.31 cm/a. The improvement of the mid-altitude (15\&ndash;140 m) point was the most obvious after GACOS correction, and the accuracy was increased by about 23\%. The accuracy for low- and high-altitude areas was roughly equal and there was no significant improvement. Additionally, GACOS correction may increase the error for some points, which may be related to the low accuracy of GACOS turbulence data.},

	abstract = {Intensive global positioning system (GPS) monitoring after the 1999 İzmit earthquake provides an opportunity to understand the postseismic behaviour of a strike-slip fault and the rheology below the brittle upper crust. Two data sets are available: displacements measured during the first 300 days after the İzmit earthquake and velocity measurements between 2003 and 2005. Using an inversion method and a forward modelling, respectively, we investigate two mechanisms: (1) afterslip on and below the coseismic rupture plane and (2) viscoelastic stress relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle described by a Maxwell or a standard linear solid (SLS) rheology. The inversion results show that the first several months following the İzmit earthquake were dominated by afterslip at depths shallower than 30 km and the slip amount decayed with time; after that, apparent afterslip has a very different spatial distribution and is located much deeper. For viscoelastic relaxation, a model with an elastic upper crust and a Maxwell viscoelastic lower crust overlying a Maxwell mantle (E-M-M) fits the data measured in the first 300 days better in the far field than in the near field. However, the observed far-field, 300-day displacement and the long-term (2003–2005) displacement, which might be dominated by viscoelastic relaxation, cannot be described by a Maxwell rheological model with constant viscosity: the effective viscosity increases over time. Therefore, we have built a refined rheological model: an elastic upper crust and an SLS lower crust overlying a Maxwell viscoelastic mantle (E-SLS-M). Our best solution yields a viscosity for the lower crust of ∼2 × 1018 Pa s, a relaxation strength of 2/3 and a viscosity for the Maxwell mantle of 7 × 1019 Pa s. Finally, we explain the data using a composite model, consisting of the preferred E-SLS-M model and the afterslip model obtained from the residual displacement after correcting for viscoelastic relaxation. For the early time period, the residual displacements can be mainly explained by a shallow afterslip whose magnitude decays with time and whose spatial distribution is stable, whereas the residual displacements for the later time period require negligible afterslip. It indicates that the postseismic deformation in the later time period induced by a deep source can be almost entirely explained by the E-SLS-M model. The composite model can generally explain the data in the entire spatial and temporal space.},

	abstract = {A homogeneous or stratified viscoelastic half-space has often been used as a simple earth model to calculate the deformation induced by an earthquake or a regional deglaciation. Recent publications have shown that, when taking into account the coupling between the earth's gravity and the dilatational motion, the response of the model exhibits singularities for wavenumbers below a critical value (kg). It is shown here that the boundary-value problems based on such earth models have no solution at all for this low-wavenumber region (k≤kg). In fact, previous authors tried unintentionally to solve an unsolvable system by analytical or numerical extrapolation from the valid wavenumber range (k {\textgreater} kg) to the invalid range (k≤kg). Therefore, non-physical singularities appear in their numerical results. In particular, the previous elastic-gravitational dislocation theory includes an incorrect treatment of these singularities, which may lead to significant errors in the deformation models. This paper analyses the mathematical and physical causes for the unsolvability and proposes a consistent way to solve the difficulty. In particular, numerical tests show that an elastic-gravitational deformation model would become even less reliable than the corresponding elastic model, if the coupling between gravity and deformation were considered in the incorrect way published previously.},

	abstract = {We present a new numerical code for modeling co- and post-seismic response of the Earth's crust to earthquakes. The code consists of two FORTRAN programs: the first program, PSGRN, calculates the time-dependent Green functions of a given layered viscoelastic-gravitational half-space for four fundamental dislocation sources [the strike–slip double–couple, the dip–slip double–couple, the compensated linear vertical dipole (CLVD) and the point inflation] at different depths. The results provide a data base for the second program, PSCMP, which automatically discretizes the earthquake's extended rupture area into a number of discrete point dislocations and calculates the co- and post-seismic deformation by linear superposition. According to the correspondence principle, the same propagator algorithm used in our previously published elastic modeling software, EDGRN/EDCMP, is adopted to compute the spectral Green functions. The temporal Green functions are then obtained by the fast Fourier transform extended with an anti-aliasing technique, that ensures numerical stability when calculating the post-seismic transients. Moreover, the new software considers the coupling between the deformation and the Earth's gravity field, so that its output includes not only the complete deformation field consisting of 3 displacement components, 6 stress (strain) components and 2 tilt components, but also the geoid and gravity changes. In particular, the gravity effect is treated using a new consistent approach that remedies an incorrect formulation used in many earlier publications. The performance of the software is shown by an example.},

To understand the seismogenic mechanism and the post-seismic deformation behavior, we investigated the characteristics of the post-seismic deformation fields in the seismic area, using 9 Sentinel-1A TOPS synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from 18 July 2015 to 22 September 2016 with the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. Postseismic LOS deformation displayed logarithmic behavior, and the temporal evolution of the post-seismic deformation is consistent with the aftershock sequence. The main driving mechanism of near-field post-seismic displacement was most likely to be afterslip on the fault and the entire creep process consists of three creeping stages. Afterward, we used the steepest descent method  to invert the afterslip evolution process and analyzed the relationship between post-seismic afterslip and co-seismic slip. The results witness that 447 days after the mainshock (22 September 2016), the afterslip was concentrated within one principal slip center. It was located 5–25 km along the fault strike, 0–10 km along with the fault dip, with a cumulative peak slip of 0.18 m. The 447 days afterslip seismic moment was approximately 2.65 × 1017 N m, accounting for approximately 4.1\% of the co-seismic geodetic moment. The deep afterslip revealed that a creeping process from steady-state “secondary” creeping to accelerating “tertiary” creep in the deep of fault.

However, on the eastern segment of the ATF at 91.5\&ndash;95\&deg;E, high spatial resolution deformation has not been previously reported. Here, we processed 185 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images from three descending tracks of the C band ERS-1/2 and Envisat satellites spanning 1995\&ndash;2011 and obtained the average deformation velocity field. Results show a left-lateral motion of {\textasciitilde}4 mm/year along the fault-parallel direction across the ATF at 91.5\&ndash;95\&deg;E, which is consistent with Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. The slip deficit rate distribution at shallow depths was resolved through the InSAR deformation velocity using a discretized fault plane. The slip deficit is capable of an Mw 7.9 earthquake, considering the elapsed time of the latest M 7.0 event. Two potential asperities that could be nucleation sites or rupture areas of future earthquakes were delineated based on the coupling coefficient and seismicity distributions along the fault plane. The larger asperity extends more than 100 km along the ATF at depths of 8\&ndash;12 km. Our InSAR observations support the undeformed blocks model of the Indo-Eurasian collisional mechanism at the northern margin of the Tibetan plateau.},

We determine that the upper flat of the MHT is nearly totally locked, the crustal ramp is partially locked, and that free slip is localized only along the lower flat north of the Himalaya. This location of increased coupling probably corresponds to the brittle/ductile change in rheology along the MHT and explains the location of very large (greater than the Gorkha 2015 event) earthquake epicenters north of the crustal ramp. Including the simulation of the Western Nepal Fault System in the continuation of the Karakorum fault does not improve simulation of the interseismic velocity field. The 25 April Gorkha earthquake nucleated in a highly coupled part of the upper flat of the MHT and propagated eastward along a less coupled part of the MHT.},

In this paper, we invert the co-seismic GPS and InSAR data for a robust finite-fault model of the Kunlun earthquake based on a realistic fault geometry buried in a layered earth structure. The inversion is based on the constrained least-squares principle and realized using the steepest decent method (SDM). The different data sets are weighted according to their variance and spatial coverage. The results show that the slip maximum can reach up to ∼6.9 m and is located at 35.76° N and 93.40° E. The main rupture area is located at the shallow depth above 20 km. The inverted shallow slip agrees with the surface rupture observed by the field survey, and the whole slip pattern appears generally consistent with the results obtained from previous geological and seismic wave studies.},

	abstract = {GPS-derived horizontal velocities, geologic fault slip rates and earthquake-derived fault slip vector azimuths are inverted simultaneously for fault coupling and slip rate deficit on the Haiyuan-Liupanshan fault in the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Along the Haiyuan fault, the results show 3.2–6.2mm/yr of left-lateral strike-slip, and the strike-slip transformed into thrusting deformation (2.8–3.5mm/yr) along the Liupanshan fault. The results suggest full coupling down to ∼10km along the Haiyuan fault. Significant portions from the Jinqianghe fault to the Maomaoshan fault, however, are locked to ∼23km depth. The abrupt change in fault coupling coincides with the Tianzhu seismic gap. High slip rate deficit (3.0–4.5mm/yr) and seismic moment accumulation rate are also interpreted along the seismic gap. The Liupanshan fault is locked to 15–20km depth. A high seismic moment accumulation rate, low slip rate deficit (2.0–3.2mm/yr) and scarcity of large seismic event over the last 1400 years may imply high strain accumulation on the fault. The results demonstrate that crustal deformation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is dominated by elastic block rotation. We also conclude that deformation due to fault coupling is limited along the near-field (less than 50km with velocities less than 2mm/yr) of the Haiyuan-Liupanshan fault.},

	abstract = {Previous studies in the forearc of the northern Chilean subduction zone have identified important tectonic features in the upper crust. As a result of these works, the West Fissure Fault System (WFFS) has recently been imaged using microseismic events. The WFFS is the westward-dipping, sharp lower boundary of the northern Chilean forearc and is geometrically opposed to subduction of the Nazca plate. The present article builds on this previous work and is novel in that it characterizes this structure's stress distribution using focal mechanisms and stress tensor analysis. The results of the stress tensor analysis show that the state of stress in the WFFS is related to its strike-slip tectonic context and likely represents a manifestation of local forces associated with the highest areas in the Andes. Two seismic clusters have also been identified; these clusters may be associated with a blind branch of the WFFS. We studied these clusters in order to determine their sources and possible connection with fluid migration across the upper plate. We observed that the two clusters differ from one another in some regards. The central cluster has characteristics consistent with an earthquake swarm with two clearly identifiable phases. Conversely, the SW cluster has a clear main shock associated with it, and it can be separated into two subclusters (A and A΄). In contrast, similarities among the two clusters suggest that the clusters may have a common origin. The b-values for both clusters are characteristic of tectonic plate boundaries. The spatial spreading, which is approximately confined to one plane, reflects progressive growth of the main fracture underlying the swarm and subcluster A. We also find that earthquakes themselves trigger aftershocks near the borders of their rupture areas. In addition, the spatio-temporal migration of hypocentres, as well as their spatial correlation with areas that are interpreted to be fluid migration zones, suggest that there is a close relationship between fluid movement and the earthquake sources associated with the swarm and subcluster A. These observations point to stick-slip behaviour of the rupture propagation, which can be explained by earthquake-induced stress transfer and fluid flow in a fluid-permeated, critically loaded fault zone.},

The velocity field exhibits an asymmetric velocity gradient on either side of the EPF. We use five different approaches to explore possible models to explain this asymmetry. First, we infer a 1.6 km locking depth using a classic elastic half-space dislocation model. Second, we infer a 1.5 km locking depth and a 0.33 asymmetry coefficient using a heterogeneous asymmetric model, including contrasting material properties on either side of a vertical fault, suggesting that the igneous-metamorphic terranes on the northern side are 2 times more rigid than the sedimentary southern side. Third, we use a three-dimensional elastostatic model to evaluate the presence of a compliant zone, suggesting a 30\% reduction of rigidity in the upper 3 km at the depth of a 1 to 5 km wide fault zone. Fourth, we evaluate the distribution of fault slip, revealing a widespread partial creep pattern in the eastern upper segment, while the upper western segment exhibits a partially locked area, which coincides with the rupture surface of the 1797 and 1929 earthquakes. To supplement these models, we upgrade the previously published displacement simulation method using nonvertical dislocations with data acquired between 2003 and 2013. The localized aseismic displacement pattern associated with creeping or partially creeping fault segments could explain the low level of historic seismicity.},

An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 (Mw) occurred in this region on February 3, 1996. The Lijiang earthquake was the largest normal-faulting event to occur along the western boundary of the Sichuan–Yunnan Block in the last 40years. In this study, we used L-band JERS-1 (Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1) SAR data sets from two descending orbits to detect surface deformation signals surrounding the epicentral region in order to estimate the source parameters through an inversion of the displacement fields. The results indicated that the earthquake can be explained by slip along two segments of the ∼N–S trending listric normal fault, named the Lijiang–Daju fault. Coseismic deformation patterns and slip distributions revealed that the earthquake consisted of two sub-events, which were also suggested by seismological results. Based on an analysis of the static Coulomb stress change, the second sub-event was likely triggered by the first sub-event. The central segment of the Lijiang–Daju fault, which has an eastward-convex geometry, did not rupture during the earthquake. This phenomenon was probably related to a geometrical discontinuity at the fault-bend area of the Lijiang–Daju fault.},

	abstract = {We use about two decades of geodetic measurements to characterize interseismic strain build up along the Central Andes subduction zone from Lima, Peru, to Antofagasta, Chile. These measurements are modeled assuming a 3-plate model (Nazca, Andean sliver and South America Craton) and spatially varying interseismic coupling (ISC) on the Nazca megathrust interface. We also determine slip models of the 1996 Mw = 7.7 Nazca, the 2001 Mw = 8.4 Arequipa, the 2007 Mw = 8.0 Pisco and the Mw = 7.7 Tocopilla earthquakes. We find that the data require a highly heterogeneous ISC pattern and that, overall, areas with large seismic slip coincide with areas which remain locked in the interseismic period (with high ISC). Offshore Lima where the ISC is high, a Mw∼8.6–8.8 earthquake occurred in 1746. This area ruptured again in a sequence of four Mw∼8.0 earthquakes in 1940, 1966, 1974 and 2007 but these events released only a small fraction of the elastic strain which has built up since 1746 so that enough elastic strain might be available there to generate a Mw {\textgreater} 8.5 earthquake. The region where the Nazca ridge subducts appears to be mostly creeping aseismically in the interseismic period (low ISC) and seems to act as a permanent barrier as no large earthquake ruptured through it in the last 500 years. In southern Peru, ISC is relatively high and the deficit of moment accumulated since the Mw∼8.8 earthquake of 1868 is equivalent to a magnitude Mw∼8.4 earthquake. Two asperities separated by a subtle aseismic creeping patch are revealed there. This aseismic patch may arrest some rupture as happened during the 2001 Arequipa earthquake, but the larger earthquakes of 1604 and 1868 were able to rupture through it. In northern Chile, ISC is very high and the rupture of the 2007 Tocopilla earthquake has released only 4\% of the elastic strain that has accumulated since 1877. The deficit of moment which has accumulated there is equivalent to a magnitude Mw∼8.7 earthquake. This study thus provides elements to assess the location, size and magnitude of future large megathurst earthquakes in the Central Andes subduction zone. Caveats of this study are that interseismic strain of the forearc is assumed time invariant and entirely elastic. Also a major source of uncertainty is due to fact that the available data place very little constraints on interseismic coupling at shallow depth near the trench, except offshore Lima where sea bottom geodetic measurements have been collected suggesting strong coupling.},

	abstract = {In 2007 a M7.7 earthquake occurred near the town of Tocopilla within the northern Chile seismic gap. Main shock slip, derived from coseismic surface deformation, was confined to the depth range between 30 and 55 km. We relocated ∼1100 events during six months before and one week after the main shock. Aftershock seismicity is first congruent to the main shock slip and then it spreads offshore west and northwest of Mejillones Peninsula (MP). Waveform modeling for 38 aftershocks reveals source mechanisms that are in the majority similar to the main shock. However, a few events appear to occur in the upper plate, some with extensional mechanisms. Juxtaposing the Tocopilla aftershocks with those following the neighboring 1995 Antofagasta earthquake produces a striking symmetry across an EW axis in the center of MP. Events seem to skirt around MP, probably due to a shallower Moho there. We suggest that the seismogenic coupling zone in northern Chile changes its frictional behavior in the downdip direction from unstable to mostly conditionally stable. For both earthquake sequences, aftershocks agglomerate in the conditionally stable region, whereas maximum inter-seismic slip deficit and co-seismic slip occurs in the unstable region. The boundary between the unstable and conditionally stable zones parallels the coastline. We identify a similar segmentation for other earthquakes in Chile and Peru, where the offshore segments break in great M {\textgreater} 8 earthquakes, and the onshore segments in smaller M {\textless} 8 earthquakes. Using critical taper analysis, we demonstrate a causal relationship between varying slip behavior on the interface and forearc wedge anatomy that can be attributed to spatial variations in the rate-dependency of friction.},

	abstract = {We study a large Mw = 7.6 earthquake that occurred on 2007 November 14 in the Northern Chile seismic gap near the city of Tocopilla. Using a variety of seismic data we show that this earthquake ruptured only the lower part of the interplate seismic zone and generated a series of plate interface aftershocks. Two large aftershocks on 2007 November 15 ruptured the interplate zone oceanwards of the Mejillones Peninsula, a major geographical feature in the Antofagasta region. On 2007 December 16, a large Mw = 6.8 aftershock, that occurred near the southern bottom of the fault plane of the main event, is shown to be a slab-push earthquake located inside the subducted Nazca Plate and triggered by along slab compression. Aftershocks of this event demonstrate that it occurred on an almost vertical fault. The Tocopilla earthquake took place just after the installation of a new seismological network by Chilean, German and French researchers. The accelerometric data combined with far ﬁeld seismic data provide a quite complete and consistent view of the rupture process. The earthquake broke a long (130 km) and narrow (about 30–50 km) zone of the plate interface just above the transition zone. Using a non-linear kinematic inversion method, we determined that rupture occurred on two well-deﬁned patches of roughly elliptical shape. We discuss the consequences of this event for models of gap ﬁlling earthquakes in Chile proposed in the 1970s.},

	abstract = {The Nankai Trough in Southwest Japan exhibits a wide spectrum of fault slip, with long-term and short-term slow-slip events, slow and fast earthquakes, all associated with different segments down the plate interface. Frictional and viscous properties vary depending on rock type, temperature, and pressure. However, what controls the down-dip segmentation of the Nankai subduction zone megathrust and how the different domains of the subduction zone interact during the seismic cycle remains unclear. Here, we model a representative cross-section of the Nankai subduction zone offshore Shikoku Island where the frictional behavior is dictated by the structure and composition of the overriding plate. The intersections of the megathrust with the accretionary prism, arc crust, metamorphic belt, and upper mantle down to the asthenosphere constitute important domain boundaries that shape the characteristics of the seismic cycle. The mechanical interactions between neighboring fault segments and the impact from the long-term viscoelastic flow strongly modulate the recurrence pattern of earthquakes and slow-slip events. Afterslip penetrates down-dip and up-dip into slow-slip regions, leading to accelerated slow-slip cycles at depth and long-lasting creep waves in the accretionary prism. The trench-ward migrating locking boundary near the bottom of the seismogenic zone progressively increases the size of long-term slow-slip events during the interseismic period. Fault dynamics is complex and potentially tsunami-genic in the accretionary region due to low friction, off-fault deformation, and coupling with the seismogenic zone.},

	abstract = {Most of the deformation associated with the seismic cycle in subduction zones occurs offshore and has been therefore difﬁcult to quantify with direct observations at millennial timescales. Here we study millennial deformation associated with an active splay-fault system in the Arauco Bay area off south central Chile. We describe hitherto unrecognized drowned shorelines using high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, geomorphic, sedimentologic, and paleontologic observations and quantify uplift rates using a Landscape Evolution Model. Along a margin-normal proﬁle, uplift rates are 1.3 m/ka near the edge of the continental shelf, 1.5 m/ka at the emerged Santa María Island, À0.1 m/ka at the center of the Arauco Bay, and 0.3 m/ka in the mainland. The bathymetry images a complex pattern of folds and faults representing the surface expression of the crustal-scale Santa María splay-fault system. We modeled surface deformation using two different structural scenarios: deep-reaching normal faults and deep-reaching reverse faults with shallow extensional structures. Our preferred model comprises a blind reverse fault extending from 3 km depth down to the plate interface at 16 km that slips at a rate between 3.0 and 3.7 m/ka. If all the splay-fault slip occurs during every great megathrust earthquake, with a recurrence of {\textasciitilde}150–200 years, the fault would slip {\textasciitilde}0.5 m per event, equivalent to a magnitude {\textasciitilde}6.4 earthquake. However, if the splay-fault slips only with a megathrust earthquake every {\textasciitilde}1000 years, the fault would slip {\textasciitilde}3.7 m per event, equivalent to a magnitude {\textasciitilde}7.5 earthquake.},

Assuming an elastic crust, one can roughly estimate the location and rate of accumulation of elastic stress. However, this general framework does not account for inelastic, irrecoverable deformation, which results in large-scale topography. We do not know over which part of the earthquake cycle such deformation occurs. Using InSAR and GNSS measurements, we report on a potential correlation between long-term, inelastic vertical rate and short-term, interseismic vertical rate in northern Chile. Approximately 4\% to 8\% of the geodetically derived interseismic vertical rates translate into permanent deformation, suggesting that topography of the forearc builds up during the interseismic period. This observation provides a quantitative basis for an improved understanding of the interplay between short-term and long-term dynamics along convergent plate boundaries.},

	abstract = {Over long-term geological scales, the position and vertical movements of the coast are considered to be among the most important effects resulting from first-order plate tectonics interactions in the subduction zones. However, the relationship between short-term vertical deformation driven by earthquakes and long-term coastal uplift in the Andean subduction contact of northern Chile has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Based on precise radiocarbon dating and geomorphological analysis of littoral deposits in the Mejillones Peninsula at the southern edge of the major northern Chile seismic gap, we report a drastic increase in coastal uplift since marine isotope stage 3 (MIS 3) with uplift rates one order of magnitude more rapid than previously in the Late Pleistocene. Geomorphological evidence supplied by Holocene littoral deposits and marine terraces shows that this tectonic regime could be operating at present. Together with new geodetic data following the 2007 Mw7.7 Tocopilla event, these observations indicate that coastal uplift results from cumulative coseismic vertical displacement with low subsequent interseismic subsidence recovery driven by both deep-moderate and large megathrust earthquakes. We suggest that the accelerated coastal uprising and earthquake rate over the past ∼44 ka demonstrated in this work results from changes involving the entire subduction contact between the Nazca and South American plates in northern Chile.},

To improve our undestanding of seismotectonic processes affecting the MP, we built a new catalog of aftershocks of the 1995 Antofagasta earthquake (Mw 8.1) recorded by the CINCA seismic network. In addition, we build a three-dimensional tomographic model to determine the physical properties of the upper plate using arrival times from our new catalog combined with other earthquakes catalogs derived from several networks deployments across the MP. We detected seismicity in the outer wedge of the upper plate. The seismicity is partially defined by a clear lineament between 22 and 5 km depth that we defined as a splay fault. The focal mechanisms indicate a rupture plane with NE orientation and SE dip. The seismicity in the upper plate and splay fault are located in the areas in which the Vp and Vs velocities are decreased and the Vp/Vs ratio is increased, suggesting a fractured fault zone within the outer wedge of the upper plate. We propose the presence of fluids in the fracture fault zone within the outer wedge because the decrease in Vs larger than that of Vp and repeating earthquakes clusters were detected. Our observations present clear evidence of the activation of the splay fault in the outer wedge of the North Chilean offshore forearc.},

	abstract = {We study the distribution of the aftershocks of Tocopilla Mw 7.7 earthquake of 2007 November 14 in northern Chile in detail. This earthquake broke the lower part of the seismogenic zone at the southern end of the Northern Chile gap, a region that had its last megathrust earthquake in 1877. The aftershocks of Tocopilla occurred in several steps: the first day they were located along the coast inside the co-seismic rupture zone. After the second day they extended ocean-wards near the Mejillones peninsula. Finally in December they concentrated in the South near the future rupture zone of the Michilla intermediate depth earthquake of 2007 December 16. The aftershock sequence was recorded by the permanent IPOC (Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory in Chile) network and the temporary task force network installed 2 weeks after the main event. A total of 1238 events were identified and the seismic arrival times were directly read from seismograms. Initially we located these events using a single event procedure and then we relocated them using the double-difference method and a cross-correlation technique to measure time differences for clusters of aftershocks. We tested a 1-D velocity model and a 2-D one that takes into account the presence of the subducted Nazca Plate. Relocation significantly reduced the width of the aftershock distribution: in the inland area, the plate interface imaged by the aftershocks is thinner than 2 km. The two velocity models give similar results for earthquakes under the coast and a larger difference for events closer to the trench. The surface imaged by the aftershocks had a length of 160 km. It extends from 30 to 50 km depth in the northern part of the rupture zone; and between 5 and 55 km depth near the Mejillones peninsula. We observed a change in the dip angle of the subduction interface from 18° to 24° at a depth of 30 km. We propose that this change in dip is closely associated with the upper limit of the rupture zone of the main event. We also studied the focal mechanisms of the aftershocks, most of them were thrust events like the mainshock. As the aftershock activity was significantly reduced, on 2007 December 13, an ML 6.1 event occurred offshore of the Mejillones peninsula reactivating the seismicity. Three days later the Michilla intraslab earthquake of Mw 6.8 ruptured an almost vertical fault with slab-push mechanism. The aftershocks locations of this event define a planar zone about 11 km in depth, situated right bellow the subduction interface.},

	abstract = {Precise locations of aftershocks following a large subduction earthquake offers insights into the nature of the seismogenic zone interface and stress redistribution within the subducting plate and its overburden. In 1995 a large magnitude Mw=8.0 earthquake in Antofagasta, northern Chile marked the beginning of an aftershock sequence recorded for 2 months on a dense temporary network surrounding the rupture region. In this study we use cross-correlation and a double-difference relocation technique to obtain high-precision locations for this aftershock dataset. Relocation of the aftershock sequence reveals topography of the subducting Nazca plate and indicates that the slab is deeper to the south. The majority of the seismicity is located in a thin (∼1–1.5 km) region on the seismogenic interface. We also find seismicity located just above the seismogenic interface in the overlying continental crust. Particularly a streak of seismicity that extends ∼8 km vertically from the seismogenic interface into the overlying continental crust and is in close proximity to a region of large VP/VS ratio interpreted as the migration of trapped subduction fluid. Analysis of the seismicity streak yields a strong correlation between time and focal depth for events within this streak and indicates a fluid flow of ∼105 m/day giving a continental crust permeability of 10−14–10−15 m2. Focal mechanism data shows predominantly dip slip motion for these events, in contrast to thrust motion along the seismogenic interface, accommodating stress redistribution in the overriding plate. One could interpret this streak as the migration of fluid along a previous weak fault zone. Alternatively, the seismicity streak is located close to the bottom of the 1995 rupture and therefore one would expect large stress unloading in this area. The normal faulting in the overlying continental plate could be secondary faulting an effect of stress reorientation after the main thrust event. This relaxation of stress could have re-activated previous weak fault zones not only in the overlying continental crust but also in the subducting slab.},

	abstract = {Coralline algae that may be predominant in the upper part of the infralittoral zone along rocky shorelines proved to be a useful indicator of rapid coastal uplift. As these encrusting algae cannot survive desiccation, even for short periods at low tide, they can provide estimates of positive vertical motions like those which may accompany seismic events. The desiccation of a fringe of the algal encrustment, at the base of the intertidal area (=infralittoral fringe), combined with effects of solar radiation rapidly kills the organisms. This mortality results in a conspicuous alteration of the pigmentation from pink/beige/reddish to white. After the July 30, 1995 Antofagasta earthquake (Mw 8.1), in northern Chile, such a white fringe appeared in some parts of the bay of Antofagasta and surroundings. The width of the dead algae fringe varied from 0 to more than 1.8 m. The widest observed widths are related to local parameters (exposition to wave splash, geometric disposition) that account for an amplification of the width of the dead algae fringe, and must be identified. Thus, a careful study of each locality led us to determine the extent of the coastal areas that had been uplifted, and to reconstruct, with a precision of the order of 2 cm, the amount of the vertical deformation along the Antofagasta Bay and southern Mejillones Peninsula. It was thus shown that the coastline bordering the town of Antofagasta suffered practically no coseismic uplift, while areas to the south and to the west of Antofagasta Bay proved to have been uplifted by as much as 25 and 40 cm, respectively. The maximum uplift (80 cm) was seen at the southwestern tip of the peninsula of Mejillones. These precise reconstructions are of great help for the calibration of geodetic studies performed independently and for the modelling of the coseismic deformation at a regional scale.},
